# Portfolio

We are here to create a modern Portfolio SPA with AngularJS 1.5.x. Throughout our project we are going to use recently introduced components directives. Let's have a quick look first:

Follow steps below to bootstrap the application:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:angularjs-recipes/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
npm install -g bower grunt-cli live-server
npm install && bower install
live-server
```

The application is already launched pointing to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/#/`
